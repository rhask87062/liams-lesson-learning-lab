## Current Session Changes

### Overflow and Viewport Handling - CORRECTED APPROACH
- **Simple Solution**: Enhanced viewport meta tag with `maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, viewport-fit=cover` for better mobile handling
- **Global Overflow**: Maintained `overflow: hidden` on body to prevent unwanted scrolling (crucial for Magic Paint)
- **Layout Preservation**: Reverted all component layouts back to original working `min-h-screen` approach
- **Desktop First**: Ensured desktop layouts work perfectly while improving mobile experience
- **Minimal Changes**: Avoided over-engineering - kept what worked, fixed only what was broken

### Problem Solved - Simplified Approach
The initial complex responsive solution broke desktop layouts. The corrected approach maintains:
- ‚úÖ `overflow: hidden` globally (prevents unwanted scrolling)  
- ‚úÖ Enhanced mobile viewport meta tag (better mobile browser handling)
- ‚úÖ Original working layouts (desktop compatibility preserved)
- ‚úÖ All content fits within viewport (no cut-off issues)

This minimal, targeted fix achieves the goal without breaking existing functionality.

### Lab Background Implementation - Simplified
- **User Request**: Add lab.png background image to RootMenu
- **Initial Over-Engineering**: Added complex lab equipment animations, science emojis, and glow effects without permission
- **User Correction**: Removed all extra elements per user feedback - they only wanted the background image
- **Final State**: Clean RootMenu with just lab.png background, simplified title, and original activity grid intact
- **Lesson Learned**: Follow user instructions precisely - don't add extra features without explicit request

### Lab Asset Navigation Implementation
- **Major UI Transformation**: Replaced gradient card buttons with interactive lab assets
- **Asset-to-Game Mapping**: 
  - Telescope ‚Üí Spelling Games (positioned by window)
  - Microscope ‚Üí Letter Learner (left counter)
  - Chemistry Set ‚Üí Magic Paint (bottom left) 
  - Computer ‚Üí Matching Game (bottom right)
  - Whiteboard ‚Üí Progress Reports (top center)
- **Interactive Features**: Hover effects with scaling, opacity changes, and drop shadows
- **Permanent Labels**: Game names displayed below each asset with semi-transparent backgrounds
- **Immersive Experience**: Users now click on actual lab equipment to access learning activities
- **Accessibility Preserved**: Maintained keyboard navigation and tab indices

### Banner and Progress Button Enhancements
- **Banner Implementation**: Replaced text title with banner.png image, sized properly (h-16 md:h-20) and positioned at very top
- **Progress Button Upgrade**: Added blue glow effect, scale animation, and "Progress Data" label with Impact font
- **Layout Optimization**: Banner no longer displaces lab assets, maintains clean positioning
- **Consistent Interactions**: Progress button now has same hover effects as lab equipment (glow, scale, label animation)

## Session Conclusion
Successfully transformed the RootMenu into an immersive lab experience with interactive equipment serving as game navigation. The banner.png title is properly sized and positioned at the top, while all lab assets (telescope, microscope, computer, fossil) have engaging hover effects with colored glows, scaling animations, and styled labels. The progress button maintains consistent interaction patterns with glow effects and labeling. The entire interface now provides a cohesive, playful learning environment.

### Hover Area Fix - Final Session Task
- **Problem Identified**: Hover effects only triggered when hovering over label text, not the entire asset area
- **Solution Implemented**: Removed Button components and restructured clickable areas as divs with extended hover zones
- **Enhanced Accessibility**: Added tabIndex and onKeyDown handlers for proper keyboard navigation
- **Padding Extension**: Added `p-8` class to expand clickable/hoverable area around each lab asset
- **Navigation Preserved**: Maintained all original asset positions and click functionality for proper game routing

- **Asset Import**: Added imports for all new space-themed image assets at component level
- **Animation Enhancement**: Added missing animation keyframes for rocket-fly-by and gentle-bounce effects
- **Visual Consistency**: Maintained existing animations and positioning while upgrading to high-quality image assets
- **Selective Updates**: Kept star as emoji ‚≠ê per user specification, replaced all other space elements with images
- **Performance Optimized**: Properly sized image elements with responsive width/height classes for different screen sizes

### Rocket Animation Customization - FINAL FIX
- **Trajectory Update**: Changed rocket path from diagonal arc to bottom-right ‚Üí top-middle trajectory
- **Rotation Added**: Implemented -15¬∞ tilt toward upper-left throughout animation
- **CSS Override Issue**: Discovered and removed duplicate fly-by animation in App.jsx inline styles that was overriding App.css
- **Animation Parameters**: Maintained 30s duration with 5s delay, proper scaling and opacity transitions
- **UI Cleanup**: Also removed SpellingMenu header with book emoji and title for cleaner layout

### Critical Bug Fix - CSS Specificity
- **Problem**: Inline CSS in App.jsx was overriding external App.css animations
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate fly-by keyframes from App.jsx inline styles
- **Result**: App.css animations now properly control rocket trajectory and rotation
- **Lesson**: Inline styles have higher specificity than external stylesheets 

## Session 3: Fixing Microscope Item Animation (continued)

### User Feedback: Items moving too quickly and spiraling
- Issue: Items were rotating and moving too fast, not realistic for liquid suspension
- Solution implemented:
  1. Removed rotation from float animation completely
  2. Changed to gentle up/down movement with slight horizontal drift
  3. Increased animation duration from 5-6s to 8-26s per cycle
  4. Added varied radii (30-38%) for more organic positioning
  5. Removed inline style jsx that was defining old animation
- Result: Items now float gently like they're suspended in liquid 

## Session 4: Word List Management in Curriculum Settings

### User Request: Make word list editable from within curriculum settings
- Added word list management functionality to Progress Dashboard's Curriculum Settings tab

## Session 5: Differentiated Movement for Living Microbes

### User Request: Living microbes with propulsion should move more quickly
- Added movement type classification to all microscopic items:
  - **Active** (4-6s): Amoeba, Paramecium, Euglena, White Blood Cell - have means of propulsion
  - **Passive** (8-12s): Red Blood Cell, Virus, Mold Spore - no self-propulsion, drift slowly
  - **Static** (12-18s): Diatom, Sodium Crystal, Pollen Grain - non-living particles
- Created new CSS animation `float-active` with more dynamic movement pattern
- Active microbes now have:
  - Faster animation cycles
  - Larger movement ranges (up to 12px displacement)
  - More erratic, lifelike motion patterns
- Result: Living microbes with propulsion now move noticeably faster and more dynamically than passive/static items 

## Session 6: Fix Missing Input Import in Progress Dashboard

### Issue: ReferenceError - Input is not defined
- Error occurred in ProgressDashboard component when trying to use Input component
- Root cause: Input component was not imported from UI library
- Solution: Added `import { Input } from '@/components/ui/input.jsx';` to imports
- Result: Progress Dashboard and Curriculum Settings now load without errors 

## Session 7: Fix Target Card Image Clarity

### User Request: Target card image appears discolored and blurred
- Issue: Target card had semi-transparent background (bg-white/90) and backdrop blur
- Changes made:
  1. Changed card background from `bg-white/90 backdrop-blur-md` to `bg-white` (fully opaque)
  2. Updated letter overlay from `text-black/80 bg-white/60` to `text-black bg-white/90`
  3. Added border to letter circle for better definition
- Result: Target card now displays crisp, clear images without any blur or discoloration 

## Session 8: Fix Progress Dashboard Scrolling

  - Base64 storage for offline access
- Result: Teachers can now add words and get appropriate images automatically generated 

## Session 10: Organize Assets into Component-Specific Folders

### User Request: Move SpellingMenu assets to dedicated folder
- Moved space-themed assets from `src/assets/` to `src/assets/spelling-menu/`:
  - moon.png
  - meteor.png
  - ufo.png
  - cow.png
  - rocket.png
- Updated import paths in SpellingMenu.jsx to reflect new location
- Result: Better organization of assets by component/feature 

## Session 11: Update Image Generation Prompt for Tighter Shots

### User Request: Add tight shot specification to image prompt
- Updated OpenAI image generation prompt to include: "In a very tight shot so that the images display large in my app"
- Full prompt now: "Please generate an image of a [word], in a cartoonish and colorful style appropriate for a toddler with a transparent background. In a very tight shot so that the images display large in my app."
- Result: Generated images will be more zoomed-in/close-up, making them appear larger and more prominent in the app 

## Session 12: Fix Target Card Letter Overlay Blocking Image

### User Request: Letter circle was blocking the microscopic image
- Issue: Large letter circle (w-20 h-20) was centered over the image, obscuring it
- Changes made:
  1. Moved letter to bottom-right corner (absolute positioning)
  2. Reduced letter circle size from w-20/24 to w-12/14
  3. Reduced font size from text-5xl/6xl to text-3xl/4xl

  - Removed petri dish circular container
  - Updated FloatingItem positioning to use grid layout across full screen
  - Items now float freely across entire viewport with grid-based positioning

## Session 15: Consistent Letter Display
- **Issue**: Target card letter displayed differently than floating items (small corner vs centered overlay)
- **Solution**:
  - Updated target card to match floating item letter style
  - Letter now centered over image with same size (text-4xl md:text-5xl)
  - Same white color with drop shadow for consistency
  - Makes matching much easier for users

## Session 16: Crosshair Overlay and Item Positioning
- **Issue**: Background reticule not visible over items, items floating outside petri dish area
- **Solution**:
  - Added crosshair overlay with bold black lines at 50% X and Y axes
  - Lines use pointer-events-none to not interfere with clicking
  - Changed item positioning from grid to circular constraint system
  - Items now stay within 10-30% radius from center
  - Prevents items from going outside the petri dish viewing area
